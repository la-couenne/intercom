# Multi-station wifi intercom with a Raspberry Pi

I suggest you discover an object that children really enjoy, but that can also be adapted as a door intercom.

I searched a lot for a way to stream audio over wifi, and finally I carried out my project in the way that seemed easiest to me: using an SSH connection and the arecord / aplay commands of the ALSA driver from the sound output of our Raspberry Pi. The principle is simple, we press the button when we speak, and our interlocutor hears us ðŸ™‚ Otherwise I use a USB micophone, an amplified speaker, and a Python file.

# List of equipment (for an intercom)
1 Raspberry Pi
1 Micro SD Card
1 AC adapter (I used a 5v 6A to also power the amp)
1 USB microphone
1 8 Ohms 10W speaker (depending on the amp)
1 amplifier for the speaker (I used that of Adafruit 20W MAX9744)
1 cable with 2 Jack sockets
1 10mm red LED (emission indicator)
2 push buttons at least (one to talk and one to turn off the Raspberry)
1 resistance of 100 Ohms
1 resistance of 10 KOhms
1 bakelite plate
